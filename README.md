## compiling and deploying 
_will look into how to deploy all contracts at one time in the future._ 

for now, compiles all contracts but deploys one.

pass contract you wish to deploy as commandline arg `node deploy.js <Example>`
also take a look at the built-in scripts for example usage.

add additional contracts to `compile.js` as needed.
